# Prosper Loan Data Analysis
## by Sangwon Lee


## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

* The ProsperRating column and the CreditGrade column have the same content divided according to a specific period.
* Among the 81 columns, it was the prosper rating and income range that showed a significant effect among the four (debt to income ratio, employment status duration, prosper rating, and income range) that were expected to have a significant impact on estimated and actual return.


## Key Insights for Presentation

* Estimated return and actual return seem to be less for people with low risk.
* When the estimated return and actual return for the actual loan amount were calculated, the lower the risk, the greater the tendency.
* If we look at this from an investor's point of view, we can interpret the high-risk person and the low-risk person as follows:
  * When the risk is high, the loan interest rate is calculated high to reduce the total amount of loans and prepare for losses.
  * When the risk is low, the loan interest rate is lowered to increase the total amount of loans to induce more people to borrow.
