    "# Traditional Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "**One educated, but potentially biased opinion on the traditional methods** is that these methods are no longer necessary with what is possible with statistics in modern computing, and these methods will become even less important with the future of computing. Therefore, memorizing these formulas to throw at a particular situation will be a glazed-over component of this class. However, there are resources below should you want to dive into a few of the hundreds if not thousands of hypothesis tests that are possible with traditional techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about the traditional methods, see the documentation [here on the Stat Trek site](https://stattrek.com/hypothesis-test/hypothesis-testing.aspx) on the corresponding hypothesis tests. In the left margin of this Stat Trek page, you will see a drop-down list of the hypothesis tests available, as shown in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./assets/l11_10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these hypothesis tests is linked to a corresponding confidence interval, but again the bootstrapping approach can be used in place of any of these! Simply by understanding what you would like to estimate, and simulating the sampling distribution for the statistic that best estimates that value."

    "# Recap\n",
    "In this lesson, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to use your knowledge of bootstrapping and sampling distributions to create a confidence interval for any population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You learned how to build confidence intervals for the population mean and difference in means, but really the same process can be done for any parameter you are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You also learned about how to use Python built-in functions to build confidence intervals, but that these rely on assumptions like the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You learned about the difference between **statistical significance** and **practical significance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, you learned about other language associated with confidence intervals like **margin of error** and **confidence interval width**, and how to correctly interpret your confidence intervals. Remember, confidence intervals are about **parameters** in a population, and not about individual observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Next\n",
    "The topics of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing essentially do the same thing, but depending on who you talk to or what source you are reading from, it is important to understand both.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson, you will be learning about hypothesis testing!"
